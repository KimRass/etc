# KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
## DAU (Daily Active Users), WAU (Weekly Active Users), MAU (Monthly Active Users)
- Source: https://mixpanel.com/blog/mau/
- MAU stands for monthly active user, ***it's the number of users that have done something meaningful in your product in the last 30 days/calendar month.***
- ***It’s up to you to determine what the definition of “active” means for your company; it could be visiting your website, logging into the app, viewing a post, or completing a specific event. The desired time period of measurement will vary across different industries and products. For instance, a bank wouldn’t expect their users to check their balance daily, but a social media company would anticipate this type of frequency.***
- ***MAU (Monthly Active Users) is considered a key performance indicator (KPI) for many businesses.*** MAU can tell you:
	- General health of a business
	- Success of a marketing campaign in attracting new users
	- Level of interest in a product or service
	- *Retention rate*
	- *Churn rate*
	- Growth rate and potential (particularly if you don’t have paid users yet)
	- Revenue growth and potential
- *Most importantly, MAU can indicate the perceived value of an app, service, or product.*
- ***You can use the calendar month or any 30-day period when calculating the monthly active users. Each unique user is counted only once, even if they are active numerous times throughout the day or month.***
### DAU/MAU
- These metrics can also be used to calculate the DAU/MAU ratio. Simply divide DAU by MAU to get the user ratio percentage. Example: If you have 1,000 daily users and 5,000 monthly users, the DAU/MAU ratio is 20%. ***The DAU/MAU ratio will tell you the rate of returning users (a.k.a. stickiness).*** A high rate suggests good engagement and perceived value, whereas a low rate indicates a lack of interest that requires further analysis.
## LTV (LifeTime Value)

# Power User
- Source: https://mixpanel.com/blog/power-users/
- ***Power users are the individuals that interact with your product the most when compared to other customers.*** The definition of a power user will vary by industry and company for example, a Finance company may define their power user as someone who logs in 2x a week, while a consumer tech app may expect their powers users to sign in multiple times a day.
- But power users are at their most impactful when they make their network your network. They are usually the first to sing your praises and leave a glowing review or recommend your business to their Twitter feed, family, or friends. Their enthusiasm becomes a powerful source of new business.

# Agile
- Source: https://www.atlassian.com/agile
- Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. *Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.*
- *Open communication, collaboration, adaptation, and trust amongst team members are at the heart of agile.*

# ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
- Enterprise resource planning (ERP) refers to a type of software that organizations use to manage day-to-day business activities such as accounting, procurement, project management, risk management and compliance, and supply chain operations.
- ERP systems tie together a multitude of business processes and enable the flow of data between them. By collecting an organization’s shared transactional data from multiple sources, ERP systems eliminate data duplication and provide data integrity with a single source of truth.

# SCM
- Source: https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-management
- *Supply chain management is the handling of the entire production flow of a good or service — starting from the raw components all the way to delivering the final product to the consumer. A company creates a network of suppliers (“links” in the chain) that move the product along from the suppliers of raw materials to those organizations that deal directly with users.*

# Sales
- Source: https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-sales
- *Sales refers to all activities involved in selling a product or service to a consumer or business.*
- *The goal is to reach out to leads who have shown interest in or fit the description of the company’s target customer, in hopes of providing them with a solution that results in a purchase of your product or service.*

# Commerce
- The activity of buying and selling, especially on a large scale.
## Marketing
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing
- ***Marketing is the process of intentionally stimulating demand for and purchases of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging to be more attractive to buyers; selection of the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand.*** Marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency.

# Wireframe & Storyboard
## Wireframe
- Source: https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/
- ![image]( https://balsamiq.com/assets/learn/articles/all-controls-split-r.png)
- A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you, your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.
- Doing this work now, before any code is written and before the visual design is finalized, will save you lots of time and painful adjustment work later.
- Wireframes make it clear that no code has been written yet. If your customer or stakeholder received some screens that looked like screenshots of the final app, instead of a wireframe, they might assume that all the code behind those screenshots had already been written. This is most often not the case. Wireframes don't have this danger.
- Source: http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-wireframe-and-storyboard/
- Wireframe is a page schematic, a sketch of your website before any kind of development or design element goes into it. It is basically a visual representation of the layout of your website without the fancy elements such as colors, fonts, shading, or just any other design element that makes your website visually appealing and interactive.
- A wireframe is a linear representation of a website or web page structure, kind of a mock up screen of what the actual thing will look like.
## Storyboard
- 요청하는 고객이 작성해야만 하며 기획자가 대신 작성해주지 못함.
- 버전 이력 관리가 필요.
- 사용자 화면과 관리자 화면이 모두 있어야 함.
- Source: http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-wireframe-and-storyboard/
- Storyboard is kind of advanced wireframing created on a piece of paper using a pencil or using a graphics program on a computer.
- A storyboard is a more detailed representation, a high level outline including descriptions of what happens as user goes further inside the application. Storyboards are more dynamic in structure in terms of grouping and ordering.

# MOU (Memorandum Of Understanding)
- Source: https://legalvision.com.au/memorandum-of-understanding/
- *A memorandum of understanding (MOU) falls somewhere between a written contract and a handshake deal. It is a preliminary written agreement, outlining the framework or key terms they will later include in a formal contract.* An MOU is a useful tool because it helps ensure all parties are on the same page. Generally speaking, the document is not legally binding. However, if its content resembles that of a contract, it may be legally binding and therefore enforceable.
- *An MOU is often used in commercial partnerships to establish mutual goals and expectations. It sets out the rights and obligations of each party, which they incorporate into a formal contract at a later date.*

# Online marketplace
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_marketplace
- An online marketplace (or online e-commerce marketplace) is a type of e-commerce website *where product or service information is provided by multiple third parties.* Online marketplaces are the primary type of multichannel ecommerce and can be a way to streamline the production process.
- *In an online marketplace, consumer transactions are processed by the marketplace operator and then delivered and fulfilled by the participating retailers or wholesalers. These type of websites allow users to register and sell single items to many items for a "post-selling" fee.*
- Some online marketplaces have a wide variety of general interest products that cater to almost all the needs of the consumers, others are consumer specific and cater to a particular segment.

# Crowdfunding
- Source: https://learning.candid.org/resources/knowledge-base/what-is-crowdfunding/
- *Crowdfunding is a way to raise funds for a specific cause or project by asking a large number of people to donate money, usually in small amounts, and usually during a relatively short period of time, such as a few months. Crowdfunding is done online, often with social networks, which make it easy for supporters to share a cause or project cause with their social networks.*

# M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions)
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions
- In corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are transactions in which the ownership of companies, other business organizations, or their operating units are transferred or consolidated with other entities. As an aspect of strategic management, M&A can allow enterprises to grow or downsize, and change the nature of their business or competitive position.
- From a legal point of view, a* merger is a legal consolidation of two entities into one, whereas an acquisition occurs when one entity takes ownership of another entity's share capital, equity interests or assets.*

# Value Chain
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain
- A value chain is a set of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable product (i.e., good and/or service) to the end customer.

# Fast Fashion
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion
- Fast fashion is a term used to describe a highly profitable and exploitative business model based on replicating catwalk trends and high-fashion designs, mass-producing them at low cost. Oftentimes, this entails exploiting workers in inhumane conditions. The term fast fashion is also used to generically describe the products of the fast fashion business model. Some of these retailers, like Primark, H&M and Zara, became large multinationals using business models based on high turnover of inexpensive clothing from the efficient production lines, to create more seasonal and trendy designs that are aggressively marketed to fashion-conscious consumers. Fast fashion applies an extreme version of planned obsolescence to clothing. Because these designs are changing so quickly and are so cheap, consumers buy more clothing than they would previously, so expectations for those clothes to last decrease. Stealing designs is also common.

# BI (Business Intelligence)
- Source: https://www.datawarehouse4u.info/What-is-Business-Intelligence.html
- ***Technology infrastructure for gaining maximum information from available data for the purpose of improving business processes. Typical BI infrastructure components are as follows: software solution for gathering, cleansing, integrating, analyzing and sharing data. Business Intelligence produces analysis and provides believable information to help making effective and high quality business decisions.***
- The most common kinds of Business Intelligence systems are:
	- EIS (Executive Information Systems)
	- DSS (Decision Support Systems)
	- MIS (Management Information Systems)
	- GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
	- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing and multidimensional analysis)
	- CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
## EIS
- Source: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1016/executive-information-system-eis
- ***An executive information system (EIS) is a decision support system (DSS) used to assist senior executives in the decision-making process. It does this by providing easy access to important data needed to achieve strategic goals in an organization. An EIS normally features graphical displays on an easy-to-use interface.***
## CRM (Customer Relationship 
- Source: https://www.salesforce.com/ap/crm/what-is-crm/
- ***Customer relationship management (CRM) is a technology for managing all your company’s relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers.***
- *A CRM solution helps you focus on your organization’s relationships with individual people* — including customers, service users, colleagues, or suppliers — throughout your lifecycle with them, including finding new customers, winning their business, and providing support and additional services throughout the relationship.
- ***Everyone in your company can see how customers have been communicated with, what they’ve bought, when they last purchased, what they paid, and so much more.***
- Though CRM systems have traditionally been used as sales and marketing tools, ***customer service teams are seeing great benefits in using them. Today’s customer might raise an issue in one channel — say, Twitter — and then switch to email or telephone to resolve it in private. A CRM platform lets you manage the inquiry across channels without losing track, and gives sales, service, and marketing a single view of the customer.***
- ***Your customers may be contacting you on a range of different platforms including phone, email, or social media — asking questions, following up on orders, or contacting you about an issue. Without a common platform for customer interactions, communications can be missed or lost in the flood of information — leading to a slow or unsatisfactory response.***

# Technology Stack
- https://mixpanel.com/blog/what-is-a-technology-stack/
- A technology stack, also called a solutions stack, technology infrastructure, or a data ecosystem, is a list of all the technology services used to build and run one single application. The social site Facebook, for example, is composed of a combination of coding frameworks and languages including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and ReactJS. This is Facebook’s ‘tech stack.’

# Prequel & Sequel
## Prequel
- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel
- *A prequel is a literary, dramatic or cinematic work whose story precedes that of a previous work, by focusing on events that occur before the original narrative.*
## Sequel
- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel
- *A sequel is a work of literature, film, theatre, television, music or video game that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work. In the common context of a narrative work of fiction, a sequel portrays events set in the same fictional universe as an earlier work, usually chronologically following the events of that work.*

# Reboot
- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)
- *In serial fiction, the term "reboot" signifies a new start to an established fictional universe, work, or series. A reboot discards continuity to re-create its characters, plotlines and backstory from the beginning. It has been described as a way to "rebrand" or "restart an entertainment universe that has already been established".*

# MBA

# Man-Month
- Source: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/man-month#:~:text=Noun,consumed%20to%20perform%20some%20task.
- One person's working time for a month, or the equivalent, used as a measure of how much work or labor is required or consumed to perform some task.

# A/B Testing (= Bucket Testing, Split-Run Testing)
- A/B testing is a user experience research methodology. A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. *A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.*
- A/B testing is a shorthand for a simple randomized controlled experiment, in which two samples (A and B) of a single variable are compared. *These values are similar except for one variation which might affect a user's behavior.*
- *A/B tests are useful for understanding user engagement and satisfaction of online features like a new feature or product. Large social media sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram use A/B testing to make user experiences more successful and as a way to streamline their services.*
- *Version A might be a version used at present (thus forming the control group(= 대조군)), while version B is modified in some respect vs. A (thus forming the treatment group(= 실험군)).*
- Multivariate testing or multinomial testing is similar to A/B testing, but may test more than two versions at the same time or use more controls.

# Display Resolution
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080i
- The "i" is an abbreviation for "interlaced"; this indicates that only the odd lines, then the even lines of each frame (each image called a video field) are drawn alternately, so that only half the number of actual image frames are used to produce video.
- The "p" refers to progressive scan, which indicates that the lines of resolution for each frame are "drawn" on the screen in sequence.
## List of Common Resolutions
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_resolutions
- HD: 1280 × 720, 16:9, 921,600pixels

# AI Upscaling
- Source: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/02/03/what-is-ai-upscaling/
- Traditional upscaling starts with a low-resolution image and tries to improve its visual quality at higher resolutions. ***AI upscaling takes a different approach: Given a low-resolution image, a deep learning model predicts a high-resolution image that would downscale to look like the original, low-resolution image.***

# Types of Display
## CRT (Cathode-Ray Tube)
- Source: https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-a-crt-monitor.htm
- A CRT (cathode-ray tube) monitor is an analog display device *that creates a visible image on the screen by directing three electron beams over millions of phosphor dots to make them light up. In a color monitor, the screen is composed of numerous stripes of alternating red, green, and blue phosphor dots, which get activated by the electrons and combine to make countless different hues.*
- The electron beam repetitively scans the entire front of the tube to “paint” and refresh the image nearly 100 times every second. Computer monitors and televisions that use CRT technology have large, heavy physical casings. *The long length between the front screen and the back of the case is necessary to accommodate the length of the vacuum tube.*
## LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
- Source: https://www.orientdisplay.com/knowledge-base/lcd-basics/what-is-lcd-liquid-crystal-display/
- Instead of firing electrons at a glass screen, *an LCD has a backlight that provides light source to individual pixels arranged in a rectangular grid. Each pixel has a RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) sub-pixel that can be turned on or off. When all of a pixel’s sub-pixels are turned off, it appears black. When all the sub-pixels are turned on 100%, it appears white. By adjusting the individual levels of red, green, and blue light, millions of color combinations are obtained.*
## LED (Light-Emitting Diode)

# Rasterize
- Source: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/rasterize.htm
- *Rasterize is converting a vector image (a mathematically defined image of points and curves) to a raster image (a picture composed of discrete pixels).* More plainly, taking scene geometry and converting it to pixels for display on a screen or for printing purposes.

# Image File Formats
## JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)/JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format)
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_format#JPEG/JFIF
- JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a lossy compression method; JPEG-compressed images are usually stored in the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) file format. The JPEG/JFIF filename extension is JPG or JPEG. Nearly every digital camera can save images in the JPEG/JFIF format, *which supports eight-bit grayscale images and 24-bit color images (eight bits each for red, green, and blue). JPEG applies lossy compression to images, which can result in a significant reduction of the file size. Applications can determine the degree of compression to apply, and the amount of compression affects the visual quality of the result. When not too great, the compression does not noticeably affect or detract from the image's quality, but JPEG files suffer generational degradation when repeatedly edited and saved.*
## GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
- The GIF is in normal use limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors (while 24-bit color depth is technically possible). *GIF is most suitable for storing graphics with few colors, such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos, and cartoon style images, as it uses LZW lossless compression, which is more effective when large areas have a single color, and less effective for photographic or dithered images. Due to GIF's simplicity and age, it achieved almost universal software support. Due to its animation capabilities, it is still widely used to provide image animation effects, despite its low compression ratio compared to modern video formats.*
## PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
- Compared to JPEG, PNG excels when the image has large, uniformly colored areas. Even for photographs – where JPEG is often the choice for final distribution since its compression technique typically yields smaller file sizes – *PNG is still well-suited to storing images during the editing process because of its lossless compression.*

# Data Governance
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance
- Here the focus is on an individual company. Here data governance is a data management concept concerning the capability that enables an organization to ensure that high data quality exists throughout the complete lifecycle of the data, and data controls are implemented that support business objectives. The key focus areas of data governance include availability, usability, consistency,[2] data integrity and data security and includes establishing processes to ensure effective data management throughout the enterprise such as accountability for the adverse effects of poor data quality and ensuring that the data which an enterprise has can be used by the entire organization.

A data steward is a role that ensures that data governance processes are followed and that guidelines enforced, as well as recommending improvements to data governance processes.

Data governance encompasses the people, processes, and information technology required to create a consistent and proper handling of an organization's data across the business enterprise. It provides all data management practices with the necessary foundation, strategy, and structure needed to ensure that data is managed as an asset and transformed into meaningful information.[3] Goals may be defined at all levels of the enterprise and doing so may aid in acceptance of processes by those who will use them. Some goals include

Increasing consistency and confidence in decision making
Decreasing the risk of regulatory fines
Improving data security, also defining and verifying the requirements for data distribution policies[4]
Maximizing the income generation potential of data
Designating accountability for information quality
Enable better planning by supervisory staff
Minimizing or eliminating re-work
Optimize staff effectiveness
Establish process performance baselines to enable improvement efforts
Acknowledge and hold all gain
These goals are realized by the implementation of data governance programs, or initiatives using change management techniques.

When companies desire, or are required, to gain control of their data, they empower their people, set up processes and get help from technology to do it.[5]

According to one vendor, data governance is a quality control discipline for assessing, managing, using, improving, monitoring, maintaining, and protecting organizational information. It is a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods.[6]
