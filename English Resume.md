### Development of an Algorithm for Calculating the Sale Price of a new apartment (2020.01 ~ 2020.11)
- The purpose of this project was to maximize sales revenue by developing an algorithm to calculate the sale price of a new apartment based on data, not human intuition.
- Data was collected mainly through web scrapping, and used XGBoost as a model.
- As a result, it was confirmed that MAPE could be reduced by nearly half compared to the current simple average method. Plus, a 10-year change in preference for the floor and the area of the apartment was derived.
